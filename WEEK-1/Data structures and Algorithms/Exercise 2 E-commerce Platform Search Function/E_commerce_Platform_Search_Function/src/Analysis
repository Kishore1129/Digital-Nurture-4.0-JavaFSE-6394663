 Step 1: Understanding Asymptotic Notation
 
What is Big O Notation?
Big O notation describes the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time or space as the input size n grows. It helps developers analyze and compare the scalability of different algorithms.

Common Time Complexities:

Notation	    Description
O(1)			Constant time – runtime doesn't change with input size. 
O(log n)		Logarithmic time – input is halved each step. 
O(n)			Linear time – runtime increases proportionally to input size. 
O(n²)			Quadratic time – nested loops. 

Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios:

Best Case-	    The algorithm performs the minimum steps 
Average Case-	Expected performance across all inputs 
Worst Case-	    Maximum steps required 

Step 4: Analysis and Time Complexity Comparison

Time Complexity Table

Feature			Linear Search		Binary Search
Best Case		O(1) 				O(1) 
Average Case	O(n)				O(log n)
Worst Case		O(n) 				O(log n) 
Pre-requisite	None				Requires sorted array 

Which Algorithm is More Suitable for the Platform?

Performance at Scale:
An e-commerce platform can have millions of products.

Linear Search: May take up to 1,000,000 comparisons in the worst case – too slow for real-time user experience.
Binary Search: Needs only about 20 comparisons for 1,000,000 items (since 2²⁰ ≈ 1,000,000) – much faster.

Conclusion:
Binary Search is clearly more suitable for an e-commerce platform due to its logarithmic time complexity and efficiency at scale.
Linear Search is impractical for large datasets due to its linear time growth and slow response times.
